None. The provided code is well-written and clear.

******** CheckoutWizard.js ******** 

// CODE REPORT

This code imports the React library used in the code and defines a function called CheckoutWizard which takes an activeStep parameter to create a div element. The div element has a set of four other divs inside it denoting the checkout steps in a checkout wizard. The divs are then styled depending on the current step of the process, as denoted by the activeStep parameter. This code is straightforward, simple and effective to achieve the desired functionality.

// CODE ANALYSIS

This code is written in the JavaScript programming language, and makes use of the React library imported from the React package. The CheckoutWizard function correctly uses the activeStep parameter to take in the current step of the checkout wizard and then use it to style the div elements as is required. The code also makes use of const variables for the div element instead of writing it directly in the code. This makes the code more optimised, embedding the legibility for future reference.

// ERRORS

No errors exist in the code.

// SECURITY VULNERABILITIES

No security vulnerabilities exist in the code.

// SUGGESTED CORRECTIONS

No corrections are required for the code.

No code corrections are necessary for the code snippet provided.

******** MongoConfig.java ******** 


CODE REPORT: 
This code provides basic configuration for MongoDB within the given package. It enables MongoRepositories and allows for a CommandLineRunner interface that can be used to execute some tasks for data initialization or similar.

CODE ANALYSIS:
Overall, the code is well structured and provides the necessary configuration for using MongoDB with the given class. However, it is incomplete. No implementation is provided for the CommandLineRunner interface, which is necessary for some tasks.

ERRORS:
There are no errors in the code itself.

SECURITY VULNERABILITIES:
There are no obvious security vulnerabilities in this code.

SUGGESTED CODE CORRECTIONS:
To properly implement the CommandLineRunner interface, the following code should be added to the MongoConfig class: 
@Bean
public CommandLineRunner commandLineRunner(CustRepo repo) {
    return args -> {
        repo.save(new Customer("John", "Smith"));
    };
}

******** CustController.java ******** 
Code Report:

This code is correct syntax-wise, and the functions have valid arguments. The @Autowired annotations and the @RequestMapping indicate that the functions will be used in a REST API. The @CircuitBreaker annotation is being used to enable circuit breaking for the getUserAddress function, and there is a fallback method in case the circuit breaker is triggered.

Code Analysis:

Overall, the code is well-structured and easy to read. It is clear that the functions are intended to be used by a REST API, and the functions are structured to serve this purpose properly. However, there are some aspects that could be improved upon. Firstly, the naming of the variables could be improved. For example, “custDetailsAddressFallBack” could be given a more descriptive name, such as “userAddressLookupFallback”. Furthermore, functions could be split up into more distinct chunks. For example, the “saveUser” and “getUserAddress” functions could be split into multiple functions for better readability. Libraries, such as Spring Boot and Resilience4j, could also be used to simplify the code.

Errors and Security Vulnerabilities:

No errors or security vulnerabilities were identified in the code.

Suggested Code Corrections:

The following changes could be made to improve the code:

1. Rename variables for improved readability.
2. Split functions into more distinct chunks for better readability.
3. Utilise libraries, such as Spring Boot and Resilience4j, to simplify the code.

******** DailyWorker.java ******** 

Code Report
 
This code snippet is for a DailyWorker class which is a subclass of Worker. The DailyWorker class does not declare any new fields but does override the Pay method from the parent. 

Code Analysis

The code appears to be functioning correctly. The constructor of the DailyWorker class sets the name and rate fields, and the Pay method correctly returns the daily worker's pay based on the hours worked. 

Errors & Security Vulnerabilities

No errors or security vulnerabilities are present in the code as of now. 

Suggested Code Corrections

No changes or corrections are necessary.

******** Dict.java ******** 


Code Analysis:
The code provided assigns an array to each key of a map stored in the variable dict. The map is printed out to the console by taking in user input from the console and using this input as the keys of the dictionary.

Code Report:
This code functions as intended, allowing the user to input strings which will return the list of array items associated with the key. 

Errors:
No errors are present in this code.

No security vulnerabilities are present in the code.

Suggested Code Corrections:
No corrections are necessary for this code.

******** SalariedWorker.java ******** 

Code Report
The SalariedWorker class from the package com.kartik.worker implements the Worker abstract class and provides an overriden Pay method. The constructor accepts a name and rate, and the Pay() method returns the rate multiplied by the hours divided by 7.

Code Analysis
There are no errors or security vulnerabilities in this code.

Suggested Code Corrections
None.

******** Worker.java ******** 

Code Report
This code snippet instantiates a class called Worker and declares two protected fields: name, a string, and rate, an integer. The class includes a default Pay method that takes in an argument of hours and returns 0.

Code Analysis
This code appears to be the beginning of a class that should store parameters for an employee such as name and rate of pay, and a method for calculating the pay for a given number of hours. Since these fields are declared as protected, they can be accessed from within any subclass of this class.

Errors
There is no error in the code itself but it is incomplete. The Pay method does not take into account the value of rate, and will always return 0 regardless of how many hours the employee has worked. 

Security Vulnerabilities
Since this code does not include any methods for updating the protected fields, it does not create any security vulnerabilties.

Suggested Code Corrections
The Pay method should be modified to calculate and return the total pay, based on the number of hours worked and the employee's rate:

public int Pay(int hours) {
    return rate * hours;
}

There are many functions that have been implemented such as disconnect, reconect, newmodel, getCurrentModelsState, clientBid, nftUpdate, biddingStatus and dynamic_item. 

// Code Analysis
This code appears to be valid and implemented properly. However, there are some suspected security vulnerabilities which are mentioned below. The timerFunc setTimeout-function is also missing an arrow-function and is thus not properly scoped.

// Errors
The timerFunc setTimeout-function is missing an arrow-function and is thus not properly scoped.

// Security Vulnerabilities
There are no universal user-identifiers for clients, meaning that after a reconnect, a user may potentially not be validated as authentic due to their identifiers not matching stored records. 

// Suggested Code Corrections
The timerFunc setTimeout-function should be replaced with an arrow-function in order to properly scope it.

******** CustomerDetailsProxy.java ******** 



Code Report:

The code provided is missing a few critical pieces of a full Feign Client configuration. The @FeignClient annotation is missing the required URL parameter. Without a URL parameter, the Feign Client will not be able to execute any requests. Additionally, the GetMapping annotation is missing a value parameter. The value parameter specified the API endpoint to connect to. Without this parameter, the Feign Client will not know which API endpoint to connect to. 

Code Analysis: 

The provided code is missing required elements of a Feign Client configuration. Without these missing parameters, the Feign Client will not be able to connect to its API endpoint. 

Errors & Security Vulnerabilities: 

Without the necessary parameters and configuration, the Feign Client will not be able to send any API requests. This will result in the client not being able to receive the data it needs. Additionally, failing to specify an API endpoint and URL parameters can create a potential security vulnerability, as unspecified endpoints and URLs can potentially expose sensitive information. 

Suggested Code Corrections: 

The suggested corrections to the code would be to add the required parameters and configuration to the Feign Client. Specifically, add a URL parameter and a value parameter to the @FeignClient and @GetMapping annotations, respectively. 

@FeignClient(name="CUSTOMER-DETAILS", url="https://example-url.com/")
public interface CustomerDetailsProxy {
	@GetMapping(value="/customer-details/{name}")
	public String getCustAddress( @PathVariable String name);
}

******** CustRepo.java ******** 

Code Report:

This code snippet is a MongoRepository class representing a collection of customers. It is used to query the database for customer records based on certain conditions.

Code Analysis:

The code appears to be valid, but there are a few potential issues which should be addressed. Firstly, the @Query annotation does not appear to be correct, as the "dob" field is specified twice. Furthermore, the date parameters should be in ISO-8601 format, as this is the standard format for Mongo queries. Finally, the findByName method is not using an indexed query, which could lead to poor performance.

Errors and Security Vulnerabilities:

There are no errors or security vulnerabilities in the code provided.

Suggested Code Corrections:

The @Query annotation should be modified to use the $gte and $lte operators to query for documents with a dob field greater than or equal to the first parameter and less than or equal to the second. The findByName method should also use an indexed query to ensure the best possible performance.

@Query("{'dob' : {$gte : ?0}, 'dob' : {$lte : ?0}}")	
public List<Customer> findBetweenDob(Date dob1, Date dob2);

public List<Customer> findByName(@Indexed String name);

******** CustService.java ********

Suggested Code Corrections:

None.

******** auth.js ******** 

//Code Report
This code report will cover errors, security vulnerabilities, and suggested corrections for the "import jwt from 'jsonwebtoken'" line of code, found in the export statement. 

Errors:
The code seems to be properly formatted, however, the "import jwt from 'jsonwebtoken'" line of code should be changed from "import jwt from 'jsonwebtoken'" to "const jwt = require('jsonwebtoken')". This is because require should be used when importing NPM packages, not the import keyword. 
Security Vulnerabilities:
The line of code "const { authorization } = req.headers;" leaves the code vulnerable to header manipulation. This line of code should be changed to "const token = req.headers.authorization". Suggested Corrections:

•	Change the "import jwt from 'jsonwebtoken'" line of code to "const jwt = require('jsonwebtoken')".
•	Change the line "const { authorization } = req.headers;" to "const token = req.headers.authorization".

******** db.js ******** 

/*
Code Report:

The provided code is written using asynchronous code, making it efficient and reliable. The code includes error handling and checks for existing connections and closes them at the start of a new connection. The code also includes environment variables and other security measures to protect the data.

Code Analysis:

The code analysis reveals that the provided code is missing the import statement for Mongoose. Without this import, the code will not be able to connect to the MongoDB database and will instead fail with an error.

Errors and Security Vulnerabilities:

The code is missing an import statement for mongoose which will cause an error upon connection. Additionally, the code does not include any input validation, which could leave the connection vulnerable to malicious input.

Suggested Code Corrections: 

import mongoose from 'mongoose';
Add input validation
Improve error handling

******** error.js ******** 

//Code Report
It appears this file contains a handler for errors related to data access. The getError function attempts to determine whether a provided error is related to a response or some other data source, and then parses the message accordingly. The onError function appears to handle errors related to database disconnection and responds accordingly.

//Code Analysis
This code appears to function correctly and is generally well formatted and organized. It could be improved to be more clear by providing descriptive variable names, as well as using an object to encapsulate the error messages for more consistent and detailed parsing.

//Errors
This code does not appear to contain any errors.

//Security Vulnerabilities
This code does not appear to contain any security vulnerabilities.

//Suggested Code Corrections
The code could be improved by adding a try/catch block around the getError function to ensure any errors are properly caught and handled, as well as by adding a comment describing the purpose of the code. Additionally, an object could be used to encapsulate the error messages for more consistent and detailed parsing.  e.g.

const errorMessages = {
  response: err.response.data.message
  message: err.message
}

const getError = (err) => {
  try {
      return errorMessages[err]
  }
  catch (err) {
      console.log("Error: ", err.toString())
  }

The code provided appears to be mostly functioning as intended, with the code returning a page if the product requested is “not found.” However, there are several areas for improvement with the code. 

//Code Analysis 
The code does not seem to be dealing with any potential errors or exceptions that could arise from axios or from the await db.connect() methods. Additionally, the code does not appear to utilize any form of authentication or authorization for accessing the data received from axios.  Lastly, the code does not adhere to best coding practices such as utilizing constants for data that will be used throughout the code. 

//Errors and Security Vulnerabilities 
The code does not appear to handle any potential vulnerabilities as noted above. Without proper exception handling and authorization/authentication in place, the code has potential security vulnerabilities. Additionally, without proper exception handling and coding conventions, it is likely that the code is prone to errors. 

//Suggested Code Corrections 
To handle potential exceptions, try/catch blocks should be used when utilizing the await db.connect() and axios methods. Additionally, to help prevent security vulnerabilities, authorization/authentication should be implemented when accessing data sources. Lastly, constants should be used for any data that will be used for multiple times throughout the code.

******** nef.js ******** 

Code Report:
This code is a handler for an HTTP request that retrieves the product specified by the query parameter "id". It begins by connecting the database and then using the Product model to retrieve the requested product object from the database. Finally, the product object is sent back in the response.

Code Analysis:
This code is written using standard JavaScript best practices, such as using const for constants and async functions for asynchronous operations. It is also using a provided db utility to abstract away database connection and disconnection manager, which is a good practice for ensuring reliable database access.

Errors and Security Vulnerabilities:
There are no errors or security vulnerabilities in this code.

Suggested Code Corrections:
No code corrections are necessary.

******** Store.js ******** 

CODE REPORT:
This code sets up a reducer that is used to manage cookies. The code is fairly well written, with good formatting and clear naming conventions. 

CODE ANALYSIS:
There are no noticeable errors in the code. However, it is possible that some of the cookie data may be prone to manipulation, which could lead to security vulnerabilities.

SECURITY VUSNERABILITIES:
The cookie data in this code is not properly secured, making it possible for the cookies to be manipulated by a malicious user. If the data is sensitive, it is important to ensure that it is encrypted before being stored in a cookie.

SUGGESTED CODE CORRECTIONS:
To prevent tampering of the cookie data, it should be encrypted before setting it in the cookie. One way to do this is to make use of the Node.js 'Crypto' module. The following example shows how the encryption could be implemented:

const crypto = require('crypto');

// Get the cookie data
const cookieData = Cookies.get('data');

// Encrypt the cookie data
const cipher = crypto.createCipher('aes256', 'password');
let encrypted = cipher.update(cookieData, 'utf8', 'hex');
encrypted += cipher.final('hex');

// Set the encrypted cookie
Cookies.set('data', encrypted);
